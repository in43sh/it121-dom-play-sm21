        <p><span data-actor="zazu"><b>Zazu:</b>	{Slimed} Eyyccch.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="scar">Scar:	{Sarcastically overjoyed} Why! If it isn't my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="mufasa">Mufasa:	Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="scar">Scar:	{Faking astonishment} That was today? Oh, I feel simply awful.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="description">{He turns and start scraping his claws on the rock wall. Zazu cringes at the sound.}</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="scar">Scar:	{Admiring his claws} ...Must have slipped my mind.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="zazu">Zazu:	Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the king's brother, you should have been first in line!</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="description">{Scar clicks his teeth at Zazu, who has flown near his face. Zazu takes cover behind Mufasa's foreleg. Scar bends down to speak to him.}</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="scar">Scar:	Well, I was first in line... until the little hairball was born.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="mufasa">Mufasa:	{Lowering his head and meeting Scar eye to eye} That "hairball" is my son... and your future king.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="scar">Scar:	Ohh, I shall practice my curtsy.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="description">{Scar turns away and starts to exit}</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="mufasa">Mufasa:	{Warning} Don't turn your back on me, Scar.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="scar">Scar:	{Looking back} Oh, no, Mufasa. Perhaps YOU shouldn't turn YOUR back on me.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="mufasa">Mufasa:	{Roars and literally jumps in front of Scar, baring his teeth for the first time} Is that a challenge?</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="scar">Scar:	Temper, temper. I wouldn't dream of challenging you.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="zazu">Zazu:	Pity! Why not?</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="scar">Scar:	{Looking at Zazu} Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share. But, when it comes to brute strength {looking at Mufasa} ...I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="description">{Exit Scar}</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="zazu">Zazu:	{Deep sigh} There's one in every family, sire... Two in mine, actually. {perches on Mufasa's shoulder} And they always manage to ruin special occasions.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="mufasa">Mufasa:	What am I going to do with him?</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="zazu">Zazu:	He'd make a very handsome throw rug.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="mufasa">Mufasa:	{Chiding} Zazu!</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="zazu">Zazu:	And just think! Whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and BEAT him.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="description">{They exit, chuckling. Pan out into open savannah.}</span></p>
